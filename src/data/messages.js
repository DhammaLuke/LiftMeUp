Yes, it is possible to exterminate the things that can eradicate us, but not without stardust on our side.", "Have you found your quest? Although you may not realize it, you are unified.

Yearning is born in the gap where growth has been excluded. You must take a stand against greed.", "We can no longer afford to live with bondage. The complexity of the present time seems to demand an unfolding of our lives if we are going to survive. Delusion is the antithesis of life-force."
